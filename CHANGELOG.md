  - /status_set <new_status>
  - /status_set_other <id> <new_status> (GM+ command)
* Areas may now be marked as noteworthy, which will also trigger a similar IC notification on arrival or visibility change.
  - /noteworthy

  - Players are listed by showname, if unavailable edited to character, and if unavailable character folder
  - Players in the same party now show a (P)
  - Players with a custom status now show a (!)
* Added /bilockh and /unilockh GM commands. They have the effect /bilock and /unilock formerly had of showing/hiding areas from the area list. /bilock and /unilock for all ranks now does not change passage visibility for all ranks.
  - Passage visibility changes are immediately reported in the affected players' area lists
* System blankposts are now sent on area change or when blinded to clear the last character on screen for compatible clients.
* Added support for new colors available in DRO as well as the set position SP packet

  - Disconnected
  - Is in a different area
  - Changed characters
  - Has sneaked, and it is not the case the player is sneaking and they are both in a party
* Added explicit 'forwards sprite mode' via /toggle_fs. When a player has forwards sprites disabled, all recipients of their IC message will not see the player's sprite, but the last one they saw (or blank if any of the conditions described for first person mode blanks applies). By default it is on.
* Day cycle clocks are now more linked with DRO 1.0.0 by supporting time of day periods. Players in the clock range playing with compatible clients will automatically change to their time of day's version of their theme when entering a custom period or unknown time:
  - /clock_period
  - /clock_unknown
* Day cycle clocks can now have their hour length and current hour be modified via /clock_set
* Day cycle clock unpauses now take place as soon as processed rather than at most 1 second after being processed
* Added /zone_mode to set up the gamemode of a zone. Players part of an area in that zone with compatible clients will automatically change to their gamemode's version of their theme.
* Players in a party that are sneaking may now see each other via /getarea and similar. Players in the party not sneaking, or players sneaking not part of the party may not see these players
* Non-GM players that are spectators may now follow players.
  - Players that were GM and not spectators who then logged out, or non-GMs who were spectators and switched to a character stop following whoever they were following.
* Changed wording of GM login notifications, /minimap, attempting to access a locked passage, talking in an area whose IC chat is locked, following and unfollowing
* Notifications are now sent if a mod via /switch forces a target off their character (e.g. mod using /switch) to the mod, the target, and other officers in the server
* Clients with compatible clients now no longer see auxiliary extra spaces in IC if deafened nor their own messages with global IC prefixes if they have them on

* Added area parameter that allows only CMs and mods to send global messages in an area (by default false)
* Improved type checking of areas, background, config, music and character lists (they now hopefully fail earlier and more clearly if they have subtle errors)
* If a character list is changed via /refresh, all clients are switched to spectator and prompted to rejoin the server
* /banhdid now reports, if a player was already banned, what IPID was banned
* Judge buttons are now disallowed in lobby areas
* Removed support for AO1 style packets. The server will now respond only to DRO and AO2-style packets
* Server now logs 100 most recent sent and received packets in error logs
* Players that successfully call mod now receive an OOC notification acknowledging that
* Removed the limit on number of different judge buttons accepted
* Running /showname with no arguments with no showname set, or attempting to set the same showname as the one previously had, now returns an error instead of running successfully
* Added /dump to generate a server dump on request
* Added /slit, alias to /bloodtrail
* Clients sending syntactically correct but otherwise unidentifiable packets now silently log to console and server log rather than propagating an uncaught KeyError
* Allowed /cleargm to take a client ID to log out a particular client from their GM rank
* Improved output of /cleargm and /kickself for the user running the commands: they now see who they logged out or kicked respectively
* Added config/gimp.yaml so server owners can customize the output of gimped players
* Improved output of error messages if the port the server tries to use is already in use or that is beyond the range of available ports
* IC and OOC messages, as well as arguments to OOC commands, now have leading and trailing whitespace characters removed (except a chain of only spaces)
* The following server asset files may now be validated without launching a server by opening the appropriate file in server/validate, and dragging the file to check in there:
  - Areas
  - Backgrounds
  - Characters
  - Config
  - Gimp
  - Music
* /scream_set_range now allows <ALL> as an argument to indicate all areas should be able to receive a scream coming from the area the person running the command
* Added /iclock_bypass, allowing GM+ to let non-GMs in an area whose IC chat is locked to talk in IC. The effect disappears as soon as the target moves area or their area has their IC chat unlocked
* Improved output of /blind, /deafen, /gag if no arguments are passed
* Made /blind, /deafen, /gag, /bloodtrail echo the ID of the affected target as part of output message
* GMs are no longer subject to the server music flood guard
* Added /randommusic, which plays a randomly chosen track from the player's current music list
* Added /exit, which lets you exit the server from OOC
* Server initiated messages will now attempt to include desks wherever possible
* Added /zone_handicap and /zone_unhandicap. Players who enter an area part of a zone with a handicap will be subject to the imposed movement handicap automatically
    - Also added /zone_handicap_affect, which makes a player be subject to a zone handicap if their handicap was removed
* Running /sneak on an already sneaked player will now fail. Similarly, running /reveal on an already not sneaked player will now fail
* All commands that require a specific number of arguments now validate that the correct number of arguments was passed
* Zones that lose all their watchers but still have players in areas part of the zone will no longer be automatically deleted
* If an area is made part of a zone via /zone or /zone_add, all players are now notified about it. A similar behavior occurs now with /zone_remove
* All /showname_set notifications now include the old showname of the affected user if applicable
* Clients may now send empty sound effects
* Made /showname_history be available to all staff members (previously it was for moderators only)
* Added /charlog, which lists all character changes a player has gone through in a session (including character showname or iniswap changes)
* Made /whois identifiers follow the same identifier type lookup logic as other commands
* RP notifications that typically show player shownames will now try to use character shownames if available before defaulting to the character folder name
* Added /zone_tick and /zone_tick_remove to set the chat tick rate of a zone, so all players in an area part of the zone see messages with the same chat tick rate, or their own chat tick rate
* Made /switch indicate the target character, regardless of whether the switch was successful or not
* Made /zone_watch return a more specific error if the player is already watching the target zone
* Renamed certain commands that end certain features so they have a standard format:
  - /clock_cancel -> /clock_end
  - /party_disband -> /party_end
  - /timer_cancel -> /timer_end

* Added command alias /l for /look

* Fixed scream_range in area list yaml files not checking if the areas a scream can reach to from a particular area exist

* A player may change between hubs by running /hub followed by the hub ID, or by double-clicking their hub of interest in the hubs view. Changing hub is equivalent to changing to the default area of a hub

  - The allowed iniswaps override file `config/iniswaps.yaml`.
  - The compatibility bridge file `config/110_new_music.yaml`.
  - The area lists file `config/area_lists.yaml`

  - /toggle_legacy_jukebox: will toggle on and off the behavior in the area you're currently in. (Staff+ only)
  - /zone_set_legacy_jukebox <true/1/false/0>: will set on or off depending on the value provided. (Staff+ only)
