        ----------
        server : TsuserverDR
            Server the trial minigame belongs to.
        manager : GameManager
            Manager for this trial minigame.
        minigame_id : str
            Identifier of the trial minigame.
        player_limit : int or None, optional
            If an int, it is the maximum number of players the trial minigame supports. If None, it
            indicates the trial minigame has no player limit. Defaults to None.
        player_concurrent_limit : int or None, optional
            If an int, it is the maximum number of games managed by `manager` that any
            player of this trial minigame may belong to, including this trial minigame. If None, it
            indicates that this trial minigame does not care about how many other games managed by
            `manager` each of its players belongs to. Defaults to None.
        require_invitation : bool, optional
            If True, players can only be added to the trial minigame if they were previously
            invited. If False, no checking for invitations is performed. Defaults to False.
        require_players : bool, optional
            If True, if at any point the trial minigame has no players left, the trial minigame will
            automatically be deleted. If False, no such automatic deletion will happen.
            Defaults to True.
        require_leaders : bool, optional
            If True, if at any point the trial minigame has no leaders left, the trial minigame will
            choose a leader among any remaining players left; if no players are left, the next
            player added will be made leader. If False, no such automatic assignment will happen.
            Defaults to True.
        require_participant_character : bool, optional
            If False, players without a participant character will not be allowed to join the
            trial minigame, and players that switch to something other than a participant character
            will be automatically removed from the trial minigame. If False, no such checks are
            made. A player without a participant character is considered one where

        timer_limit : int or None, optional
            If an int, it is the maximum number of timers the trial minigame supports. If None,
            it indicates the trial minigame has no timer limit. Defaults to None.
        area_concurrent_limit : int or None, optional
            If an int, it is the maximum number of trial minigames managed by `manager` that any
            area of this trial minigames may belong to, including this trial. If None, it indicates
            that this trial minigamedoes not care about how many other trial minigames managed by
            `manager` each of its areas belongs to. Defaults to 1 (an area may not be a part of
            another trial minigame managed by `manager` while being an area of this trial).
        autoadd_on_client_enter : bool, optional
            If True, nonplayer users that enter an area part of the trial minigame will be
            automatically added if permitted by the conditions of the trial minigame. If False, no
            such adding will take place. Defaults to False.
        require_areas : bool, optional
            If True, if at any point the trial minigame has no areas left, the game with areas
            will automatically be deleted. If False, no such automatic deletion will happen.

        Default callback when the parent trial adds a player.
        If a player was added to the trial of the trial minigame, attempt to add the player to the
        trial minigame as well. If unsuccessful, do nothing.
        Do note the player may already be part of the trial minigame by this point: if another
        thread was also listening to this callback and acted upon it before the current thread by
        adding the player to the trial minigame.

        Parameters
        ----------
        trial : TrialManager._Trial
            Trial that generated the callback. Typically is self.get_trial().
        player : ClientManager.Client, optional
            Player that was added to the trial.

        Returns
        -------
        None.
