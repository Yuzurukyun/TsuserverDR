            If an int, it is the maximum number of hubs managed by `manager` that any
            player of this hub may belong to, including this hub. If None, it indicates
            that this hub does not care about how many other hubs managed by `manager` each
            of its players belongs to. Defaults to None.
        require_invitation : bool, optional
            If True, players can only be added to the hub if they were previously invited. If
            False, no checking for invitations is performed. Defaults to False.
        require_players : bool, optional
            If True, if at any point the hub has no players left, the hub will
            automatically be deleted. If False, no such automatic deletion will happen.

            leader among any remaining players left; if no players are left, the next player
            added will be made leader. If False, no such automatic assignment will happen.
            Defaults to True.
        require_participant_character : bool, optional
            If False, players without a participant character will not be allowed to join the
            hub, and players that switch to something other than a participant character
            will be automatically removed from the hub. If False, no such checks are
            made. A player without a participant character is considered one where

        team_limit : Union[int, None], optional
            If an int, it is the maximum number of teams the hub supports. If None, it

        timer_limit : Union[int, None], optional
            If an int, it is the maximum number of timers the hub supports. If None, it

        area_concurrent_limit : Union[int, None], optional
            If an int, it is the maximum number of hubs managed by `manager` that any
            area of this hub may belong to, including this hub. If None, it indicates
            that this hub does not care about how many other hubs managed by
            `manager` each of its areas belongs to. Defaults to 1 (an area may not be a part of
            another hub managed by `manager` while being an area of this hub).
        autoadd_on_client_enter : bool, optional
            If True, nonplayer users that enter an area part of the hub will be automatically
            added if permitted by the conditions of the hub. If False, no such adding will take
            place. Defaults to False.
        require_areas : bool, optional
            If True, if at any point the hub has no areas left, the hub
            will automatically be deleted. If False, no such automatic deletion will happen.

        Note that it may not necessarily be the case that the following hold:
        1. `old_char_name == player.hub.character_manager.get_character_name(old_char_id)`.
        2. `new_char_name == player.hub.character_manager.get_character_name(new_char_id)`.
        This can occur for example if the character list changes, which prompts the player to
        change character.

        ----------
        player : ClientManager.Client

        require_participant_character : bool, optional
            If False, players without a participant character will not be allowed to join the

            will be automatically removed from the hub. If False, no such checks are

        team_limit : Union[int, None], optional
            If an int, it is the maximum number of teams the hub will support. If None, it

            If an int, it is the maximum number of timers the hub will support. If None, it
            indicates the hub will have no timer limit. Defaults to None.
        area_concurrent_limit : Union[int, None], optional
            If an int, it is the maximum number of hubs managed by `manager` that any
            area of the created hub may belong to, including the created hub. If None, it
            indicates that this hub does not care about how many other hubs managed by
            `manager` each of its areas belongs to. Defaults to 1 (an area may not be a part of
            another hub managed by `manager` while being an area of this hubs).
        autoadd_on_client_enter : bool, optional
            If True, nonplayer users that enter an area part of the game will be automatically
            added if permitted by the conditions of the game. If False, no such adding will take
            place. Defaults to False.
        autoadd_on_creation_existing_users : bool
            If the hub will attempt to add nonplayer users who were in an area added
            to the hub on creation. Defaults to False.
        require_areas : bool, optional

        Parameters
        ----------
        creator : ClientManager.Client, optional
            The player who created this hub. If set, they will also be added to the hub.
            Defaults to None.
        player_limit : Union[int, None], optional
            If an int, it is the maximum number of players the hub supports. If None, it
            indicates the hub has no player limit. Defaults to None.
        require_invitations : bool, optional
            If True, users can only be added to the hub if they were previously invited. If
            False, no checking for invitations is performed. Defaults to False.
        require_players : bool, optional
            If True, if at any point the hub loses all its players, the hub will automatically
            be deleted. If False, no such automatic deletion will happen. Defaults to False.
        require_participant_character : bool, optional
            If False, players without a participant character will not be allowed to join the
            hub, and players that switch to something other than a participant character
            will be automatically removed from the hub. If False, no such checks are
            made. A player without a participant character is considered one where
            player.has_participant_character() returns False. Defaults to False.
        team_limit : Union[int, None], optional
            If an int, it is the maximum number of teams the hub will support. If None, it
            indicates the hub will have no team limit. Defaults to None.
        timer_limit : Union[int, None], optional
            If an int, it is the maximum number of timers the hub will support. If None, it
            indicates the hub will have no timer limit. Defaults to None.
        area_concurrent_limit : Union[int, None], optional
            If an int, it is the maximum number of hubs managed by `manager` that any
            area of the created hub may belong to, including the created hub. If None, it
            indicates that this hub does not care about how many other hubs managed by
            `manager` each of its areas belongs to. Defaults to 1 (an area may not be a part of
            another hub managed by `manager` while being an area of this hubs).
        autoadd_on_client_enter : bool, optional
            If True, nonplayer users that enter an area part of the game will be automatically
            added if permitted by the conditions of the game. If False, no such adding will take
            place. Defaults to False.
        autoadd_on_creation_existing_users : bool
            If the hub will attempt to add nonplayer users who were in an area added
            to the hub on creation. Defaults to False.
        require_areas : bool, optional
            If True, if at any point the hub has no areas left, the hub
            will automatically be deleted. If False, no such automatic deletion will happen.
            Defaults to True.

        Returns
        -------
        _Hub
            The created hub.

        Raises
        ------
