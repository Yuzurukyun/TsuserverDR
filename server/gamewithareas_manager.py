        creator : Union[ClientManager.Client, None], optional
            The player who created this game with areas. If set, they will also be added to the
            game with areas. Defaults to None.
        player_limit : Union[int, None], optional
            If an int, it is the maximum number of players the game with areas supports. If None, it
            indicates the game with areas has no player limit. Defaults to None.
        player_concurrent_limit : Union[int, None], optional

        require_invitations : bool, optional
            If True, users can only be added to the game with areas if they were previously invited.

            player added will be made leader. If False, no such automatic assignment will happen.
            Defaults to True.
        require_participant_character : bool, optional
            If False, players without a participant character will not be allowed to join the

            will be automatically removed from the game with areas. If False, no such checks are

            The concurrent area membership limit of this game with areas. Defaults to None.
        autoadd_on_client_enter : bool
            If the game with areas will always attempt to add nonplayer users who enter an area
            part of the game with areas. Defaults to False.
        autoadd_on_creation_existing_users : bool
            If the game with areas will attempt to add nonplayer users who were in an area added
            to the game with areas on creation. Defaults to False.
