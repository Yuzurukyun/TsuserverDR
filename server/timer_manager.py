class Timer:
    """
    A mutable data type for timers. A timer is a measurer of some internal time with a time
    manager. This internal time can be adjusted to tick at any non-zero custom rates including
    but not limited to

    * 1 internal second per real second (equivalent rate as a chronometer).
    * -1 internal second per real second (equivalent rate as a countdown clock).
    * 0.5 internal seconds per real second (equivalent rate as a chronometer running at half \
    real time speed).
    * -2 internal seconds per real second (equivalent rate as a countdown clock running twice the \
    real time speed).

    This internal time can be consulted at any time and will always be lower bounded by some
    timer minimum value and upper bounded by some timer maximum value. It can also be set to some
    specific value or changed by some amount of time at any time, but if it happens the new internal
    timer goes below the timer minimum value, it will set itself to the minimum value (a similar
    event happens if the new internal timer goes above the timer maximum value). This internal time
    is updated as often as the OS allows. This minimum value must be at least 0 (the internal timer
    may not become negative).

    A timer when initialized does not start automatically, but once it starts, it will tick at the
    rate described previously. This tick rate can be adjusted at any moment, so that immediately
    after the adjustment the internal timer ticks at that new rate. Once started a timer cannot be
    started again.

    A timer can be paused, so that the internal timer will stop changing. It can also be unpaused,
    so the internal timer will start changing again by the previously described rules. Attempting
    to pause a timer that was not started does nothing. Unpausing a timer that was not started
    starts it. A timer that is paused cannot be paused again, and a timer that was started and is
    not unpaused cannot be unpaused again.

    A timer can be terminated, so that the internal timer will stop changing. A timer that was
    terminated may not be started, paused, unpaused or terminated again. A timer also has an
    'auto destroy' flag, which if set to true, will also request the manager of the timer delete
    it from its list of timers as well after the timer was terminated.

    If the tick rate is positive and the internal time reaches the timer maximum value, it is said
    it has max-ended; similarly if the tick rate is negative and the internal time reaches the
    timer minimum value, it is said it has min-ended. Once a timer has max-ended, or min-ended,
    one of the following events takes place

    * If the timer was set to 'auto reset', the internal time will be adjusted to the timer \
    minimum value if the tick rate was positive and the maximum one if the tick rate was negative.
    * Otherwise, if the timer was set to 'auto destroy', it will automatically terminate itself \
    and, if the 'auto destroy' flag was set, it will request its manager delete it from its list \
    of timers.

    A timer allows the implementation different callback functions that will be executed on the
    following events:

    * When the internal timer ends automatically by min-ending.
    * When the internal timer ends automatically by max-ending.
    * When the internal timer is internally updated (although you should not put computationally \
    expensive functions here due to this callback being constantly executed).

    Overwritable Methods
    --------------------
    _on_min_end :
        Callback function to be executed if the timer's internal timer ticks down to or
        below its minimum timer value.
    _on_max_end :
        Callback function to be executed if the timer's internal timer ticks up to or
        above its maximum timer value.
    _on_refresh :
        Callback function to be executed every time the internal timer updates itself.

    Class Attributes
    ----------------
    DEF_START_TIMER_VALUE : float
        Default start value in internal seconds of the internal timer of all timers of this type.
    DEF_MIN_TIMER_VALUE : float
        Default minimum value in internal seconds of the internal timer of all timers of this type.
    DEF_MAX_TIMER_VALUE : float
        Default maximum value in internal seconds the internal timer of all timers of this type.
    DEF_TICK_RATE : float
        Default rate in internal seconds/IRL seconds at which the internal timer will tick.

    #     Number of internal seconds to add onto the real seconds elapsed per tick rate map
    #     to compute the proper internal time.
    # _last_time_update : float or None
    #     If None, the timer was not started. Otherwise, it is the last time the internal timer was
    #     updated in seconds; no base value for this can be assumed, so only differences between
    #     these values are meaningful.
    # _min_value : float

    #     or restart automatically.

    #     and the timer max-ended, or to the max value if the tick rate is negative and the timer
    #     min-ended. Otherwise, either of those situations will make the timer end automatically.

    #     If True, if the timer ends automatically, it will also make its manager delete it from

    #     For each (tick, elapsed) (key, value) pair in the dictionary, it represents the number
