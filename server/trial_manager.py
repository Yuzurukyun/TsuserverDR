        require_invitations : bool, optional
            If True, users can only be added to the NSD if they were previously invited. If
            False, no checking for invitations is performed. Defaults to False.
        require_players : bool, optional
            If True, if at any point the NSD loses all its players, the NSD will automatically
            be deleted. If False, no such automatic deletion will happen. Defaults to True.
        require_participant_character : bool, optional
            If False, players without a participant character will not be allowed to join the
            trial, and players that switch to something other than a participant character
            will be automatically removed from the trial. If False, no such checks are

        team_limit : Union[int, None], optional
            If an int, it is the maximum number of teams the NSD will support. If None, it

        timer_limit : Union[int, None], optional
            If an int, it is the maximum number of timers the NSD will support. If None, it
            indicates the NSD will have no timer limit. Defaults to None.
        autoadd_on_creation_existing_users : bool, optional
            If True, all players of the trial that are in the same area of the creator (if given a
            creator) will be automatically added to the NSD. If False, no such check is performed.
            Defaults to None.
        autoadd_on_trial_player_add : bool, optional
            If True, players that are added to the trial will be automatically added if permitted

        Parameters
        ----------
        creator : ClientManager.Client, optional
            The player who created this trial. If set, they will also be added to the trial.
            Defaults to None.
        player_limit : Union[int, None], optional
            If an int, it is the maximum number of players the trial supports. If None, it
            indicates the trial has no player limit. Defaults to None.
        require_invitations : bool, optional
            If True, users can only be added to the trial if they were previously invited. If
            False, no checking for invitations is performed. Defaults to False.
        require_players : bool, optional
            If True, if at any point the trial loses all its players, the trial will automatically
            be deleted. If False, no such automatic deletion will happen. Defaults to True.
        require_participant_character : bool, optional
            If False, players without a participant character will not be allowed to join the
            trial, and players that switch to something other than a participant character
            will be automatically removed from the trial. If False, no such checks are
            made. A player without a participant character is considered one where
            player.has_participant_character() returns False. Defaults to False.
        team_limit : Union[int, None], optional
            If an int, it is the maximum number of teams the trial will support. If None, it
            indicates the trial will have no team limit. Defaults to None.
        timer_limit : Union[int, None], optional
            If an int, it is the maximum number of timers the trial will support. If None, it
            indicates the trial will have no timer limit. Defaults to None.
        area_concurrent_limit : Union[int, None], optional
            If an int, it is the maximum number of trials managed by `manager` that any
            area of the created trial may belong to, including the created trial. If None, it
            indicates that this trial does not care about how many other trials managed by
            `manager` each of its areas belongs to. Defaults to 1 (an area may not be a part of
            another trial managed by `manager` while being an area of this trials).
        autoadd_on_client_enter : bool, optional
            If True, nonplayer users that enter an area part of the game will be automatically
            added if permitted by the conditions of the game. If False, no such adding will take
            place. Defaults to False.
        autoadd_on_creation_existing_users : bool
            If the trial will attempt to add nonplayer users who were in an area added
            to the trial on creation. Defaults to False.
        require_areas : bool, optional
            If True, if at any point the trial has no areas left, the game with areas
            will automatically be deleted. If False, no such automatic deletion will happen.
            Defaults to True.
        hub : _Hub, optional
            Hub of the hubbed game. Defaults to None (and converted to the creator's hub if given a
            creator, and None otherwise).
        autoadd_minigame_on_player_added : bool, optional
            If True, nonplayer users that are added to the trial will also be automatically added
            to the minigame if permitted by its conditions. If False, no such adding will take
            place. Defaults to False.

        Parameters
        ----------
        creator : ClientManager.Client, optional
            The player who created this trial. If set, they will also be added to the trial.
            Defaults to None.
        player_limit : Union[int, None], optional
            If an int, it is the maximum number of players the trial supports. If None, it
            indicates the trial has no player limit. Defaults to None.
        require_invitations : bool, optional
            If True, users can only be added to the trial if they were previously invited. If
            False, no checking for invitations is performed. Defaults to False.
        require_players : bool, optional
            If True, if at any point the trial loses all its players, the trial will automatically
            be deleted. If False, no such automatic deletion will happen. Defaults to True.
        require_participant_character : bool, optional
            If False, players without a participant character will not be allowed to join the
            trial, and players that switch to something other than a participant character
            will be automatically removed from the trial. If False, no such checks are
            made. A player without a participant character is considered one where
            player.has_participant_character() returns False. Defaults to False.
        team_limit : Union[int, None], optional
            If an int, it is the maximum number of teams the trial will support. If None, it
            indicates the trial will have no team limit. Defaults to None.
        timer_limit : Union[int, None], optional
            If an int, it is the maximum number of timers the trial will support. If None, it
            indicates the trial will have no timer limit. Defaults to None.
        area_concurrent_limit : Union[int, None], optional
            If an int, it is the maximum number of trials managed by `manager` that any
            area of the created trial may belong to, including the created trial. If None, it
            indicates that this trial does not care about how many other trials managed by
            `manager` each of its areas belongs to. Defaults to 1 (an area may not be a part of
            another trial managed by `manager` while being an area of this trials).
        autoadd_on_client_enter : bool, optional
            If True, nonplayer users that enter an area part of the game will be automatically
            added if permitted by the conditions of the game. If False, no such adding will take
            place. Defaults to False.
        autoadd_on_creation_existing_users : bool
            If the trial will attempt to add nonplayer users who were in an area added
            to the trial on creation. Defaults to False.
        require_areas : bool, optional
            If True, if at any point the trial has no areas left, the game with areas
            will automatically be deleted. If False, no such automatic deletion will happen.
            Defaults to True.
        hub : _Hub, optional
            Hub of the hubbed game. Defaults to None (and converted to the creator's hub if given a
            creator, and None otherwise).
        autoadd_minigame_on_player_added : bool, optional
            If True, nonplayer users that are added to the trial will also be automatically added
            to the minigame if permitted by its conditions. If False, no such adding will take
            place. Defaults to False.
