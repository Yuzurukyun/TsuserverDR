"""
Module that contains the GameManager class, which itself contains the Game and Team subclasses.

Games maintain a PlayerGroup-like structure and methods, but also allow the creation of teams with
thier players. Teams are proper PlayerGroups, and no player of a game can be part of two teams
managed by the same game. Players of a game need not be part of a team managed by the game, but a
team can only have players of the game as players of the team. Removing a player from a game
also removes them from their team if they were in any.

Games also maintain a TimerManager-like structure, allowing the creation of timers
managed by the game.

Each game is managed by a game manager, which itself maintains a PlayerGroupManager-like structure.
Unless specified otherwise in the games, a player may be part of two or more games managed by the
same game manager.

class _Game(_GameTrivialInherited):
    """
    A mutable data type for games.

    Games are groups of users (called players) with an ID, that may also manage some timers
    and teams.

    Some players of the game (possibly none) may become leaders. A player that is not a leader
    is called regular. Each game may have a player limit (beyond which no new players may be added),
    may require that it never loses all its players as soon as it gets its first one (or else it
    is automatically deleted) and may require that if it has at least one player, then that there
    is at least one leader (or else one is automatically chosen between all players). Each of these
    games may also impose a concurrent player membership limit, so that every user that is a player
    of it is at most of that many games managed by this game's manager. Each game may also
    require all its players have participant characters when trying to join the game, as well as
    remove any player that switches to a non-character.

    Each of the timers a game manages are timer_manager.Timers.

    For each managed team, its players must also be players of this game.

    Once a game is scheduled for deletion, its manager will no longer recognize it as a game
    it is managing (it will unmanage it), so no further mutator public method calls would be
    allowed on the game.

    Each game also has a standard listener. By default the game subscribes to all its players'
    updates.

    Attributes
    ----------
    server : TsuserverDR
        Server the game belongs to.
    manager : GameManager
        Manager for this game.
    listener : Listener

        Method to perform once a player of the game wants to send an IC message.
    _on_client_inbound_ms_final

    _on_client_change_character
        Method to perform once a player of the game has changed character.

        tick_rate : float, optional
            Starting rate in timer seconds/IRL seconds at which the timer will tick. Defaults to 1.
        min_value : float, optional
            Minimum value the apparent timer may take. If the timer ticks below this, it will
            end automatically. It must be a non-negative number. Defaults to None (will use the
            default from `timer_type`.)

        auto_restart : bool, optional
            If True, the timer will reset without terminating back to its max value if the tick rate
            was non-negative and the timer went below its min value, or back to its max value if
            the tick rate was negative and the timer went above its max value. If False, the
            timer will terminate once either of the two conditions is satisfied without restarting.
            Defaults to False.
        auto_destroy : bool, optional
            If True, the game will automatically delete the timer once it is terminated by it
            ticking out or manual termination. If False, no such automatic deletion will take place.

        Default callback for game player signaling it has changed character.

        By default it only checks if the player is now no longer having a participant character.
        If that is the case and the game requires all players have participant characters, the
        player is automatically removed.

        Note that it may not necessarily be the case that the following hold:
