# TsuserverDR

A Python-based server for Danganronpa Online. It is a fork from [tsuserver3](https://github.com/AttorneyOnline/tsuserver3) which is targeted towards Attorney Online.

Requires Python 3.9-3.11, PyYAML and aiohttp (follow instructions below to install).

## How to use

### Installing

It is highly recommended you read through all the installation steps first before going through them.

* Install the latest version of Python. **Python 2 will not work**.
  - You can download Python from its official website [here](https://www.python.org/downloads/). If you already have Python installed, check that your Python version satisfies the version requirement listed above.
  - If prompted during the installation to add `python` as a PATH environment variable, accept this option. You may see this option appear on the very first screen during the installation process.
  - If you know what a virtual environment is and your system supports it, it is recommended that you use one, such as [Anaconda](https://www.continuum.io/downloads) for Windows, or [virtualenv](https://virtualenv.pypa.io/en/stable/) for everyone else (it runs itself using Python). If you do not know what a virtual environment is, you may skip this point.
  - If you have Python 3.8 or lower, you will be prompted on server launch to update to a newer version of Python. That is because the server requires Python 3.9 or higher. Follow instructions under Updating to update your Python version.

* Open Command Prompt, PowerShell or your preferred terminal, and change to the directory where you downloaded TsuserverDR to. You can do this in two ways:
  - On Windows 10 or higher, go up one folder above the TsuserverDR folder, Shift + right click the TsuserverDR folder, and click `Open PowerShell window here` or `Open in Terminal`. This is the easiest method. Alternatively...
  - On most operating systems, copy the path of the TsuserverDR folder, open the terminal, and type in `cd "[paste here]"`, excluding the brackets, but including the quotation marks if the path contains spaces.

* Make sure Python is properly installed by typing `python` in the terminal and pushing Enter.
  - If text that starts with `Python 3.11.0 (main, ` or similar appears, you are all set with this step. Push Ctrl+Z followed by Enter to continue to the next step if you are on Windows; and Ctrl+D if you are on Linux.
  - If text that starts with `The term 'python' is not recognized as the name of a cmdlet` or similar, Python wasn't properly added to path. Follow the instructions [here](https://realpython.com/add-python-to-path/#how-to-add-python-to-path-on-windows) to try and fix the issue (this is for Windows, instructions for other operating systems are also available in the same website if you scroll further down).
  - If on Windows and a separate window opens that leads to the Microsoft Store, Windows may have added an execution alias. Follow the instructions [here](https://stackoverflow.com/a/58773979) to try and remove this alias.

* Install all dependencies by typing in the following two commands in the terminal you just opened:
  ```
  python -m pip install --upgrade pip
  python -m pip install --user -r requirements.txt
  ```

  If you are using Windows and have both Python 2 and 3 installed, you may do the following:
  ```
  py -3 -m pip install --upgrade pip
  py -3 -m pip install --user -r requirements.txt
  ```

  This operation should not require administrator privileges, unless you decide to remove the `--user` option.

* Rename the folder `config_sample` to `config` and edit the values in the provided YAML files to your liking. Be sure to check the YAML files for syntax errors after you are done. *Use spaces only; do not use tabs.*

* If you intend to have players outside of your network connect to your server, open or forward the port that you would like them to connect to. The port number is available in `config/config.yaml` next to `port`, and you may change it to something else if you want to. The port that you choose must be made to accept TCP connections. This whole process may involve you doing some (or all) of the following:
    - If you are hosting your server in your own device: go to your router settings, and proceed to open/forward/allow inbound connections into the port. You can typically find instructions for this by finding the brand and model name of your router, and searching "brand + model + port forwarding".
    - If you are hosting your server in an external device (such as a VPS): find its networking settings, and proceed to open/forward/allow inbound connections into the port. You can typically find instructions for this by searching something like this "your VPS + open/forward/allow inbound connections into the port".
    - Go to your operating system firewall settings, and proceed to create a rule to allow inbound connections into the port. You can typically find instructions for this by searching "your operating system + create inbound port rule".
    - Go to your third-party antivirus/firewall software settings (if you have it), and proceed to create a rule to allow inbound connections into the port (if applicable). You can typically find instructions for this by searching "your antivirus + open/forward/allow inbound connections into the port".

### Running

* To launch a server, you may either
  - Double-click `start_server.py` in your TsuserverDR folder, or...
  - In PowerShell, Command Prompt or your preferred terminal, change directory to your TsuserverDR folder and type `python start_server.py`, or `py -3 start_server.py` if you use both Python 2 and 3. For instructions on how to launch any of the above programs or change directory, refer to the second point in the Installing section.

* If everything was set up correctly, you will see something like this appear:

```
[2022-11-23T10:20:20]: Starting...
[2022-11-23T10:20:20]: Launching TsuserverDR 5.0.0 (221123a)...
[2022-11-23T10:20:20]: Loading server configurations...
[2022-11-23T10:20:20]: Server configurations loaded successfully!
[2022-11-23T10:20:20]: Starting a nonlocal server...
[2022-11-23T10:20:20]: Server started successfully!
[2022-11-23T10:20:21]: Server should be now accessible from address 192.0.2.0 and port 50000.
```

* If you are listing your server in the Attorney Online master server, make sure its details are set up correctly. In particular, make sure that your server name and description are correct, as that is how players will find your server. If everything was set up correctly, you will see something like this appear:

```
[2022-11-23T10:20:21]: Attempting to connect to the master server at https://servers.aceattorneyonline.com/servers with the following details:
[2022-11-23T10:20:21]: *Server name: My First DR Server
[2022-11-23T10:20:21]: *Server description: This is my flashy new DR server
[2022-11-23T10:20:22]: Connected to the master server.
```

  - The server will make a single ping to [ipify](https://api.ipify.org) in order to obtain its public IP address. If it fails to do that, it will let you know that, as it means there is probably something wrong with your internet connection and that other players may not be able to connect to your server.
  - Successful connection or getting a spot in the master server list does not imply that your server will be accessible to other players. In particular, you must make sure that your external port in `config/config.yaml` is open and accepting connections, which usually involves a combination of router and firewall settings. In case of doubt, you can use websites such as [Can You See Me](https://canyouseeme.org) to check if your port is visible.

* To stop the server, press Ctrl+C once from your terminal. This will initiate a shutdown sequence and notify you when it is done. If the shutdown finished successfully, you will see something like this appear:

```
[2022-11-23T22:23:04]: You have initiated a server shut down.
[2022-11-23T22:23:04]: Kicking 12 remaining clients.
[2022-11-23T22:23:04]: Server has successfully shut down.
```

* If you do not see anything after a few seconds of starting a shutdown, you can try spamming Ctrl+C to try and force a shutdown or directly close out your terminal. This is not recommended due to the cleanup process not finishing correctly but it is doable.

* To restart a server, you can follow the steps outlined above to shut down and then start the server again.

* In the unlikely event that there is an error during runtime, the server will do its best to print out to your terminal a complete traceback of the error with some additional information, as well as a more complete log file in the `logs` folder with the error timestamp, to help with debugging. Depending on the nature of the error, the server may or may not be able to continue execution normally after such an error happens.

### Updating

* If you already have a version of TsuserverDR or tsuserver3 installed and wish to update to a new version, you can download the new version and then overwrite your previously existing files. Do note that you do not need to shut down your server before overwriting the files, but you must restart it from console in order for changes to take effect.

  - This process will not overwrite your server configurations inside the `config` folder, your existing logs inside the `logs` folder, or the user information inside the `storage` folder. However, it will overwrite other files including the Python files inside the `server` folder. Therefore, make sure to save backups of those files before overwriting in case you have modified them and wish to keep an archive of your changes.

* If you want to update **Python** itself, you can get the latest Python download [from their website here](https://www.python.org/downloads/) and then follow the instructions under the Installing section in this readme. To check your current version of Python, you can run ``python`` on its own and look at the first line. The latest stable major Python release is *Python 3.11* as of October 24, 2022.

  - Please follow the installation instructions again even if you had successfully ran a server before, because your new Python installation may be missing libraries that TsuserverDR expects there to exist. You should not need to change any server configuration files though.
  - In general, updating to a Python version beyond what is specified as supported may lead to unstable behavior, so for active servers try to keep your Python version among the ones specifically labeled as supported.

### Notes

* **Note 1**: the commands may refer to the following identifiers for a player:
    - **Character Name**: the folder name of the character the player is using, also the name that appears in /getarea.
    - **HDID**: the hard drive ID of the player, accessible through /whois (requires community manager rank).
    - **ID**: number in brackets [] in /getarea.
    - **IPID**: number in parentheses () in /getarea (requires community manager rank).
    - **IP**: the IP address of the player.
    - **OOC Name**: the username of the player in the OOC chat.
* **Note 2**: some commands include commas (,) between the parameters. If that is the case, the command expects you to actually use the commas between the parameters. If for whatever reason your parameter also has a comma followed by a space, you can include it by using ,\ (so 'Hello, world' becomes 'Hello,\ world').
* **Note 3**: additional documentation for the commands can be found in `config/commands.py` and consulting the docstrings. For example, to get additional information for /help, you would look for `ooc_cmd_help` and look for the associated text.
